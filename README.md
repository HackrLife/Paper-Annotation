# Paper-Annotation
A systematic framework for annotating academic papers with integrated analysis and templated parameter mapping, designed for research in AI , digital transformtaion, governance and human-AI collaboration.

# PhD Literature Annotation Framework

A systematic framework for annotating academic papers with integrated analysis and templated parameter mapping, designed for doctoral research in AI governance and human-AI collaboration.

## Annotation Format

Each paper annotation consists of two integrated parts:

### Part 1: Detailed Textual Analysis
In-depth narrative analysis with colored callout boxes for different types of insights:

| Box Color | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| 🟡 Yellow | Historical Context |
| 🔴 Pink/Red | Critical Analysis |
| 🟢 Green | Key Insights |
| 🔵 Blue | Theoretical Integration |
| 🟣 Purple | Methodological Notes |
| ⚪ Grey | Technical Notes |

**Sections included:**
1. Executive Summary and Research Significance
2. Paper Overview and Key Contributions
3. Section-by-Section Annotations
4. Methodological Deep Dive
5. Theoretical Framework Analysis
6. Critical Assessment and Limitations
7. Implications for Research
8. Glossary of Technical Terms
9. Suggested Further Reading

## Part 2: Templated Parameter Mapping
Structured assessment against 9 key parameters:

| # | Parameter | Purpose |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Triage** | Paper type, relevance score, bucket classification |
| 2 | **Paper Identity & Positioning** | Bibliographic details, level of operation |
| 3 | **Core Claim (Distilled)** | Conditional claim structure, evidence basis |
| 4 | **System Model** | Pre/post-AI state, transformation vector |
| 5 | **Assumptions** | Technical, organisational, policy/institutional |
| 6 | **Lens Checks** | Human behaviour, incentives, institutional reality |
| 7 | **Comparative Context** | Strengths, weaknesses, literature positioning |
| 8 | **Synthesis & Research Insight** | Pattern recognition, thesis contribution, boundary conditions |
| 9 | **Metadata & Linkages** | Tags, collections, related items, follow-ups |

---

## Triage Classification

## Paper Types
- **Core**: Directly addresses research questions
- **Supporting**: Provides methodological or theoretical foundation
- **Context**: Background literature for framing
- **Peripheral**: Tangentially relevant

## Relevance Scoring
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5/5 | Essential — directly addresses RQs |
| 4/5 | High — significant contribution to argument |
| 3/5 | Medium — useful supporting evidence |
| 2/5 | Low — limited relevance |
| 1/5 | Minimal — for completeness only |

## Buckets
- Human-Machine Interaction
- AI Governance & Policy
- Organisational Theory
- Institutional Analysis
- Technical/Algorithmic
- Ethics & Accountability

## Level of Operation Framework

Papers are classified by their primary level of analysis:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SOCIETAL                               │
│  (norms, public discourse, collective)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  INSTITUTIONAL                          │
│  (governance structures, accountability)│
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ORGANISATIONAL                         │
│  (processes, roles, workflows)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TECHNICAL                              │
│  (algorithms, models, metrics)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Lens Checks

### Human Behaviour Lens
- Human role (in/on/out of the loop)
- Attention and cognitive load
- Trust calibration
- Failure modes (automation bias, algorithm aversion, deskilling, etc.)

## Incentives Lens
- Actor optimisation targets
- Gaming potential
- Goodhart risk
- Incentive alignment

## Institutional Reality Lens
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Cross-boundary coordination
- Regulatory capacity
- Accountability structures

---

## Research Questions Mapping

Each annotation maps to thesis research questions:

| RQ | Focus |
|----|-------|
| **RQ1** | How do organisations implement AI governance? |
| **RQ2** | Why do AI implementations face organisational friction? |
| **RQ3** | What institutional factors mediate AI adoption? |

---

## File Formats

## MD files
- Formatted with colored callout boxes
- Styled tables for parameter mapping
- Print-ready for physical annotation
- Compatible with reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley)

## IPYNB (Jupyter Notebook) Files
- Executable code cells for data analysis
- Visualisations of key findings
- Markdown cells for narrative
- Reproducible analysis pipeline

---

## Usage

### Creating a New Annotation

1. Copy template files to new paper directory
2. Complete Part 1 (Detailed Analysis) first
3. Fill in Part 2 (Parameter Mapping) 
4. Update metadata and linkages
5. Add to index

### Suggested Workflow

```
1. First Read     → Triage assessment
2. Deep Read      → Section-by-section annotations
3. Analysis       → Critical assessment, theoretical framework
4. Synthesis      → Pattern recognition, thesis contribution
5. Integration    → Metadata, linkages, follow-ups
```
